           <li> Net ionic equations should have only the ions that precipitate or react during a reaction. There should be no spectator ions, an ion that exists in the same form on both sides of the equation, in a net ionic equation.</li>
         <h2 class="text-center">Souble vs Insouble</h2>
           <li> Group 1 ions, ammonium, and nitrate are always soluble.</li>
         <h2 class="text-center">Percent Yeild</h2>
            <li> It is a yield of products which tends to be less than a hundred percent. This shows that the reactants arenâ€™t pure.</li>
         <h2 class="text-center">Redox Reactions</h2>
            <li> Redox Reactions are reactions that contain oxidation and reduction half-reactions in them.</li>
            <li> Oxidation half-reactions are written with the electrons placed at the product side.</li>
            <li> Reduction half-reactions are written with the electrons placed at the reactant side.</li>
            <li> Species that appear at the top of the series in your Electrode Potential table gain electrons most readily and therefore have the most positive E values. They are easily reduced and are the best oxidizing agent.</li>
            <li> Species that appear at the bottom of the series in your Electrode Potential table lose electrons most readily and therefore have the most negative E values. They are easily oxidized and are the best reducing agent.</li>

         <h2 class="text-center">Electrochemical Cells</h2>
            <li> Voltaic cells are spontaneous which means that the voltage of the cells must be negative. 
            <li> Electrolysis are nonspontaneous and require a battery to work as a form of energy to force a reaction to happen.
            <li> All electrochemical cells need a salt bridge to maintain neutrality.</li>
            <li> Anode is where the oxidation half-reaction takes place.<li>
            <li> Cathode is where the reduction half-reaction takes place.</li>
